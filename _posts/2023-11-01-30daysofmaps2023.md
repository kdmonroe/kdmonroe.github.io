A series of random maps created for the November mapping challenge of 2023. 
Authored with open source and ESRI technology.

The [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is a annual data vizualization challenge encouraging folks to make and share maps matching
the theme of the month. I only had time to do a few this year, but here are my contributions! 
This is a work in progress as I am inspired to complete new themes for missed days.


# Day 1 - Philadelphia School Types
A point map of schools across Philadelphia County, symbolized by type.

___________
# Days 2 & 3 - Philadelphia Bike Network
A map of Philadelphia's bike network, overlaying the county's neighborhood polygons. Using R's [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) 
and [simple features](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) libraries.

# Day 4  - Global Corruptions Perceptions Index Timelapse
For a "Bad" theme, I mapped the [Corruptions Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022) (CPI).
The index ranks 180 countries and territories around the world by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, 
scoring on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100. I took the public data from this site and created a map using a Python [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)

# Day 22 - North is not always up ⬆️
A simple rotating globe starting from the north pole visualized with D3 Javascript (see [D3 Geo](https://d3js.org/d3-geo)). From this angle north is down!

# Day 23 - Speed Cameras Across Maryland Census Tracts (w/ 3D Attribute Extrusion)

This scene recording was created with ArcGIS Pro using speed camera location data from the Maryland Department of Transportation, 
and state census tracts from the U.S. Census Bureau. As a frequent traveler of I-95, I was curious about the density of speed camera locations.
It could be interesting to analyze the underlying demographics of all of the communities, reviewing the equity of cameras spatial distribution.


# Summary

| Day | Theme | Keon's Map |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Points | 	A map with points |
| 2 & 3 |	Lines & Polygons| 	A map with lines and polygons |
| 4 | A Bad Map | Corruptions Perceptions Index |
| 22 | North is not always up | D3 Globe Spinning |
| 26 | Minimal | Python Prettymaps |


# Development Reflections 
Creating these maps was an exciting challenge! 
Although many are simple, I shared these online on Mastodon through the month and recieved some great feedback!
I'm definitely looking forward to next year's challenge, and also completing more maps that I missed.
