A series of random maps created for the November mapping challenge of 2023. 
Authored with open source and ESRI technology.

The [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is a annual data vizualization challenge encouraging folks to make and share maps matching
the theme of the month. I only had time to do a few this year, but here are my contributions! 
This is a work in progress as I am inspired to complete new themes for missed days.


# Day 1 - Philadelphia School Types
A point map of schools across Philadelphia County, symbolized by type.

___________
# Days 2 & 3 - Philadelphia Bike Network
A map of Philadelphia's bike network, overlaying the county's neighborhood polygons. Using R's [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) 
and [simple features](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) libraries.

# Day 4  - Global Corruptions Perceptions Index Timelapse
For a "Bad" theme, I mapped the [Corruptions Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022) (CPI).
The index ranks 180 countries and territories around the world by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, 
scoring on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100. I took the public data from this site and created a map using a Python [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)

# Day 22 - North is not always up ⬆️
A simple rotating globe starting from the north pole visualized with D3 Javascript (see [D3 Geo](https://d3js.org/d3-geo)). From this angle north is down!

# Day 23 - Speed Cameras Across Maryland Counties - 3D Attribute Extrusion and Flyover Animation

This scene recording was created with ArcGIS Pro using traffic camera location data from the Maryland Department of Transportation's [Traffic Cameras GIS Dataset](https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/maryland::maryland-traffic-cameras-traffic-cameras/about), 
and state country boundaries. As a frequent traveler of I-95, I was curious if there were any spatial patterns in the camera locations. I would next be interested in adding layers with Census Demographics data, such as household income, 
it could be interesting to analyze the underlying demographics of all of the communities, reviewing the trends of cameras spatial distribution.

This dataset also contains all categories of traffic cameras... I would be interested in filtering for just speeding cameras, although there appears to be no field available in the dataset making any categorical distinction.

Separately, there are also what seem to be livestreams links as fields in the data ([here's an example on I-695 West of York Rd](https://chart.maryland.gov/Video/GetVideo/9cff12c400ef00ac004be2369e235daa)) in this dataset which appear to correspond to each camera location. I would be interested in seeing if there is any way to integrate live video thumbnail windows or similar into a web map. I would imagine there could be some implementations already in the CCTV, defense and traffic industries...

# Development Reflections 
Creating these maps was an exciting challenge! 
Although many are simple, I shared these online on Mastodon through the month and recieved some great feedback!
I'm definitely looking forward to next year's challenge, and also completing more maps that I missed.
